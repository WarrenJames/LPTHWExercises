# Excercise 7: More Printing

# prints as "Mary had a little lamb."
print "Mary had a little lamb."
# prints as "Its fleece was white as %s" % 'snow' %s (string) equals 'snow'
print "Its fleece was white as %s" % 'snow'
# prints as "And everywhere that Mary went."
print "And everywhere that Mary went."
# prints "." 10 times as ".........."
print "." * 10

end1 = "C" # variable end1 is equal to "C"
end2 = "h" # variable end2 is equal to "h"
end3 = "e" # variable end3 is equal to "e"
end4 = "e" # variable end4 is equal to "e"
end5 = "s" # variable end5 is equal to "s"
end6 = "e" # variable end6 is equal to "e"
end7 = "B" # variable end7 is equal to "B"
end8 = "u" # variable end8 is equal to "u"
end9 = "r" # variable end9 is equal to "r"
end10 = "g" # variable end10 is equal to "g"
end11 = "e" # variable end11 is equal to "e"
end12 = "r" # variable end12 is equal to "r"

# prints variables end1 through end6 as "Cheese" comma means next printed string is on the same line.
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6,
# prints variables end7 through end12 as "Burger" on the same line as above.
print end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12

# this excercise teaches you are able to print multiple strings on the same line by seperating each by a comma.
# more than 80 characters is bad style in python
# typically you'll use single-quotes for any short strings like 'a'
