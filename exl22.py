# Exercise 22: What Do You Know So Far?

# **Exercise 0: The Set Up**

#  N/A

# **Exercise 1: A Good First Program**
print 'print is to print a string onto the terminal'

#**Exercise 2: Comment And Pound Characters**

# <- the octothorpe/pound/hash/mesh symbol comments out a line

# **Exercise 3: Numbers and Math**
3 + 3 # plus symbol is for addition
8 - 2 # minus symbol is for subtraction
48 / 8 # slash symbol is for division
3 * 3 # asterisk symbol is for multiplication
99 % 10 # percent symbol is for remainder (also used as modulo/modulus)
9 < 11 # less-than symbol
10 > 2 # greater-than symbol
6 <= 24 # less-than-equal symbol
10 >= 12 # greater-than-equal symbol

# **Excercise 4: Variables and Names**
underscores_in_variables = 1337

floatingPoint = 7.0 # numbers with decimals
integer = 7 # numbers without decimals / whole numbers

# **Exercise 5: More Variables and Printing**
rOne = 'representation modulus'
rTwo = 'raw data'

print "percent sign that gives value to the string is called a %s" % ('modulus')
print "a %s modulus is to put value to a %s" % ('string', 'string')
print "a modulus for numbers(digits) is %d " % underscores_in_variables
print "a %r is for %r, useful for debugging. Prints with quotes" % (rOne, rTwo)

# **Exercise 6: Strings and Text

print "double-quotes"
print 'single-quotes'

# **Exercise 7: More Printing**

plusOne = 'the plus symbol can be used for joining strings with'
plusTwo = 'out spaces.'
commaOne = 'The comma can be used for joining strings on same line with spaces'

print plusOne + plusTwo,
print commaOne

# **Exercise 8: Printing, Printing**
print "%r is a Boolean value that doesn't need quotes" % True
print "%r is also a Boolean value that doesn't need quotes" % False

# **Exercise 9: Printing, Printing, Printing**
print "the backslash is used to escape characters"
print "use the command \n to print on a new line"
print
    """ triple-quotes gives you the ability to set off
    multiple lines of text"""

# **Exercise 10: What was that?**
