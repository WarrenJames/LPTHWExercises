# Exercise 36: Designing and Debugging


"""
Rules for If-Statements
1.  Every if-statement must have an else.
2.  If this else should never run because it doesn't make sense, then you must
use a die function in the else that prints out an error message and dies.
3.  Never nest if-statements more than two deep and always try to do them one deep.
4.  Treat if-statements like paragraphs, where each if-elif-else grouping is like
a set of sentences. Put blank links before and after.
5. Your boolean test should be simple. If they are complex, move their calculations
to variables earlier in your function and use a good name for variable.

1.  Use a while-loop only to loop forever, and that means probably never. This
only applies to Python; other languages are different.
2.  Use a for-loop for all other kinds of looping, especially if there is a fixed
or limited number of things to loop over.

Tips for Debugging
1.  Do not use a "debugger." A debugger is like doing a full-body scan on a sick
person. You do not get any specific useful information, and you find a while lot
of information that doesn't help and is just confusing.
2.  The best way to debug a program is to use print to print out the values of
variables at points in the program to see where they go wrong.
3.  Make sure parts of your programs work as you work on them. Do not write
massive files of code before you try to run them. Code a little, run a little,
fix a little.

"""
The best way to work on a piece of software in small chunks:
1.  On a sheet of paper or an index card, write a list of tasks you need to
complete to finish the software. This is your to do list.
2.  Pick the easiest thing you can do from your list.
3.  Write out English comments in your source file as a guide for how you would
accomplish this task in your code.
4.  Write some of the code under the English comments.
5.  Quickly run your script to see if that code worked.
6.  Keep working in a cycle of writing some code, running it to test it, and
fixing it until it works.
7. Cross this task off your list, then pick your next easiest task and repeat.

This process will help you work on software in a methodical and consistent
manner. As you work, update your list by removing tasks you don't really need
and adding ones you do.
